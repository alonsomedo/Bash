Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace. By using SED you can edit files even without opening them, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.
# SED is a powerful text stream editor. Can do insertion, deletion, search and replace(substitution).
# SED command in unix supports regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.
# -n : avoid display in std
# -e : indicates to execute script
# -f : commands will be taken from a file
# -r : extends regular expressions

# Instruction
# i\: insert before current line

# c\: replace current line by the next one specified
# d: delete current line
# p: print current line in standart output
# s/: substitute current line 
# /g: (global replacement)

# ---------------------
# Its a structured variabe that allow us to store data of the same type and related.
# To access to the elements of the array you use an index
# Elements are separated by a space

# ---------------------
# the same as input in python
# -p  use it to send a message before to capture the variable , you should use double quotes

# numeric comparation
# -eq : equal
# -ge : greater or equal 
# -gt : greater than
# -le : less or equal
# -lt : less than
# -ne : not equual
# test 10 -gt 20  => [10 -gt 20]

# text comparation
# = : equal 
# > : string1 is greater than string2
# < : string1 is less than string2
# != : string1 is not equal to string2
# -n STRING: true is the longitude of the string is greater than zero

# and , or 
# ! EXPRESION: denial 
# EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2 : true if both expressions are true

-f PATH : true if the path exists and its a file
-w PATH : true if the path exists and its writable 
-x PATH : true if the path exists and its executable
-s PATH : true if the path exists and its size is greater than zero
